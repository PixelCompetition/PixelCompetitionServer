# PixelCompetitionServer

PixelCompetition is an interactive programming competition that can run online during events or offline. We are using gitHUB to develop the server and provide public sample clients, for more information please refere to: https://pixel-competition.de

A PixelCompetition is a social experiment, all participants simultaneously draw pictures on a common canvas. There are different protocols over which a pixel can be drawn. During a competition new protocols are released, so participants can then race to create their own clients.
