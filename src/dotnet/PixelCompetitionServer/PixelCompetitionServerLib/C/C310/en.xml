    <Welcome>Welcome to a future competition by Stephan</Welcome>
    <Help>
        This Competition implement a riddle protocol asking for something new
        ASK {x} {y}
        --> RIDDLE {x} {y} {riddle}

        PX {x} {y} #{color} {result}
        --> OK
        --> Nope --> RIDDLE {x} {y} {riddle}

        x:     x-Coordinate of a pixel
        y:     y-Coordinate of a pixel
        color: color encoded as a html color (rgb-values as hex)

        ASK returns a {riddle} for the given coordinate, in this competition it returns a number.
        PX  sets a pixel by providing the {result} of the riddle.

        {result} shall be something calculated from {riddle} 

        NOTE: Others may solve the riddle faster than you, in this case you get back a nope and the current riddle
