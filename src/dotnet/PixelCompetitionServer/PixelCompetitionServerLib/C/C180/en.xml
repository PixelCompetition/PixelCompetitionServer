  <Welcome>Welcome to the square root competition.</Welcome>
  <Help>
    This Competition implement a riddle protocol asking for square roots.
    ASK {x} {y}
    --> RIDDLE {x} {y} {riddle}

    PX {x} {y} #{color} {result}
    --> OK
    --> Nope --> RIDDLE {x} {y} {riddle}

    x:     x-Coordinate of a pixel
    y:     y-Coordinate of a pixel
    color: color encoded as a html color (rgb-values as hex)

    ASK returns a {riddle} for the given coordinate, in this competition it returns a number.
    PX  sets a pixel by providing the {result} of the riddle.

    {result} shall be the square root of {riddle}

    NOTE: Others may solve the riddle faster than you, in this case you get back a nope and the current riddle
